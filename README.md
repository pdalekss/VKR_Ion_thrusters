# VKR_Ion_thrusters
This repository contains my final qualifying work written before graduation from Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University. 

Theme of work - "Methodology for the study of physical processes in the electric rocket ion thruster of the spacecraft". In the course of the work, a study was made of the least studied stage in the operation of the ion thruster - the process of neutralization of the working substance. 
* A mathematical model of the process is constructed
* A capabilities of the CST computer modeling package are shown
* An algorithm in the python programming language for numerical research is developed.

The text of the work is in the file 'Pasechnik_VKR.pdf'. The main provisions of the work can be found in the presentation '8_Pasechnik.pptx'. You can find the elements of numerical modeling in the files 'VKR_code.ipynb', 'VKR_visual.ipynb'.
